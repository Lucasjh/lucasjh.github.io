Hello World!

This is my first post using the the jekyll static website generator. I just switched from Wordpress to get my hands dirty with real text editors, code, and terminal work. It feels at home considering my prior experience with ruby on rails. I'm just filling in space right now so that there is some content on my homepage, but I will have more posts up in the near future highlighting some of my current projects. Have a great day and check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on this platform.
